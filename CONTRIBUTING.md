# For contributors

My approach to this project is dictatorial.
I consider Uroboros finished. This is why I object adding new keywords, commands, big features. 
More features mean more possible trouble. 
Uroboros should stay minimalistic and plain. 
Contributors are welcome, but for keeping the project as it is - for optimizations, refactoring, tests, migrations to different platforms, bug fixes.

Only three source code files contain platform-dependent code. They are: 'main.cpp', 'os.cpp' and 'generator-os.cpp' (including headers).
