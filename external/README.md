# External dependencies

To compile this project you have to prepare manually some dependencies.

## Windows


### FFmpeg

You should prepare FFmpeg as compiled DLLs for Windows. There are two options. You compile them from official sources of FFmpeg (the recommended way). 
Or there is a shortcut. File 'ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl-shared.zip' from [here](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases) contains everything we need. Just copy the content of 'include' to 'include' here. Do the same with 'lib'.
